Git Ideas

-- GitHub Desktop -- this may be a good tool

--how integrate Git with Unity?

--how view revision history?

--how pull files to local disk?


OK, my repo is not showing up.  let's go look around




KTH -- USEFUL COMMANDS --

git --help

git init
git clone


git status 

## to change users
git config user.email
git config --global user.email "myemail@gmail.com"
git config user.name
git config --global user.name "Hagan"

## useful
git config -l

## when I got perms errors trying to check in
## this worked from https://www.freecodecamp.org/forum/t/need-your-help-with-github-permission-denied-to-my-own-repo/17421/4
@MrsColombo I had this problem too but managed to solve it, the error is that ur computer has saved a git username and password so if you shift to another account the error 403 will appear. Below is the solution
For Windows you can find the keys here:

control panel > user accounts > credential manager > Windows credentials > Generic credentials

Next remove the Github keys.
## this did not work
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:MrsColombo/elsevier-twitter-rest-api.git
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:kthagan/hello_world.git

--- this seems to be the sequence
git add
git commit
git push

-- pull to local disk, i.e. connect to a repository
git clone <repo_URL>  -- I think this is what I want.  YES!   Example:  git clone https://github.com/kthagan/repo1.git
git pull


--create new repostory --   see https://kbroman.org/github_tutorial/pages/init.html
git init <dir name>



9/21 questions:
--where is repo3?  who ownes it?  how do I sync it to another device? -- I really don't know


OK, let's focus on repo1 for now?  let's try and get that little piece working...
--OK, I have it on 2 computers.  I don't know how to connect to a new place.  let's try


OK, so the last piece is to have multiple users "clone" the directory and do checkins, etc.

also, how do I create a new reposiory?
